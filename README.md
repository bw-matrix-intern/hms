Hospital Database Management System
This project involves designing and implementing a relational database to manage the operations of a Hospital Management System. The database is structured to handle key aspects such as patient information, medical staff, appointments, treatments, billing, and more. It includes various SQL queries for handling hospital-specific operations, such as patient admissions, treatment history, and billing.

Database Design:
The system is designed with multiple interrelated tables to handle various aspects of hospital operations:

Patients: Store patient details including name, age, gender, contact information, and medical history.
Doctors: Store information about doctors, their specialization, contact info, and schedules.
Appointments: Record patient appointments with doctors, including appointment time, reason, and status.

Bills: Handle billing details for patient treatments, including charges for consultations, tests, and medication.
Staff: Store information about hospital staff such as nurses, technicians, and other support staff.   etc
